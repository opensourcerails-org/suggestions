# Suggestions

Suggested applications for the opensourcerails.org website.

To suggest an application, simply [open an issue](https://github.com/opensourcerails-org/suggestions/issues/new).

## Criteria

To get an understanding of the criteria for an application to be considered, it's important to know the mission of the site:

When I first started with Ruby on Rails, I was usually lost. I could write awful spaghetti code, sure, but I knew there was usually a better way. I'm not a classically-trained developer, nor do I have a computer science degree — or any degree, for that matter; in fact, I barely graduated high school. 

I would look at codebases to get an understand of how other developers did things — after all, I assume that because they were contributing to a larger project, they at least knew _something_. Looking back on it, they often did, and I was able to be inspired by their code to form a better understanding of the problem or problems I was trying to solve.

Having said, the criteria is loose, but tends to conform the following: 
* Projects that are unique in the area that they serve, or,
* Projects that are useful as a codebase, and sometimes, 
* Obscure projects occasionally make the cut

In addition to:
* Recent activity is very important, but not a hard requirement 
* Applications must be using at least Rails 5 (Rails 5, 6, and 7 are all very similar in their conventions and how they behave)

Nice to haves:
* In-production apps get major brownie points
* Startups
* Any sort of commercial feasibility
